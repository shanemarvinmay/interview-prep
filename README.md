## Personal Interest to look into
- mapbox
- interview pen ($100 for lifetime access) for coding and system design interviews

## Working with Dependencies in Python
* Before starting I recommend being in a virtual environment
* Install package cmd:
`python3 -m pip3 install SomePackage`
* Run your file
`py your_file.py`
